# 🚚 Dynamic Route Optimization for Delivery Systems

> C++ | Dijkstra’s Algorithm | A* Search | Graph Theory

A C++ terminal-based logistics optimization system to calculate **fastest delivery routes** using **weighted graph algorithms** (Dijkstra and A\*). It models a **city map** with coordinates and simulates real-world delivery scenarios.

## 🛠️ Features

- 📍 City map as **weighted graph**
- 🧭 **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path
- ⭐ **A* Search** using real-world coordinates
- 💬 CLI-based user input
- 🚀 Scalable design for logistics & supply chain systems

---

## 📈 Algorithms Used

- **Dijkstra’s**: Guarantees shortest path, used for static route calculation
- **A\***: Heuristic-enhanced shortest path using Euclidean distance for dynamic systems

## 📦 How to Run

### 1. Compile
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o route
